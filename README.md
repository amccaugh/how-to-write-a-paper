# Initial setup

- Make new plaintext file / Google Doc
  - Write in plain text to avoid wasting time formatting, fighting LaTeX, etc.
- Label 3 sections: "Scratchpad", "Figures", and "Outline"
  - "Scratchpad" is where you will put ideas that don't have a home in the outline yet
  - "Figures" will hold any ideas for figures/graphics you have
  - "Outline" is where you will develop your basic outline
 
# Steps 

*The goal is to work on one single step for at least 20 mins at a time, repeatedly until the step is completed.  Resist the urge to skip ahead*

### Step 0: Generate topics that may be relevant to the paper
  - Write down each topic as its own line under "Scratchpad". Each topic should only be a few words
  - Any ideas for figures should go in "Figures"
  - Potential areas to think about when coming up with ideas:  Motivation, Previous work/background, Theory, Results, Experimental setup, Conclusion, Equipment, Fabrication, Parameters, Modeling, Simulation, Caveats
  - Write down ny ideas/topics relevant to the paper, even if only somewhat related -- not all ideas from the scratchpad will end up in the outline, but the point is to make sure you don't forget/miss any ideas later on

### Step 1: Organize topics into rough sections
  - Look over your scratchpad ideas and try to come up with rough groupings for the topics
    - e.g. motivation, background, theory, experiment 1, experiment 2, analysis, future work
  - Cut the topics out of the "Scratchpad" section and paste them into your rough groupings
  - Continue organizing until most topics from your scratchpad have an (approximate) home
  - If you think of new topics, add them to the scratchpad

### Step 2: Create the initial outline
  - Expand each topic into simple bullet points w/incomplete grammar but complete logic
  - Use shorthand sentences & do not use correct grammar! There are two reasons for this:
    - Most of these points will likely be rewritten/reformatted, so you don't want to waste effort writing that will be deleted later
    - It's much easier to read/rearrange a list of shorthand sentences than long ones, and you may do a lot of rearranging
    - Example:
      - silicon good for making transistors
      - transistors used for digital computation
      - digital computation important to AI
      - silicon necessary for AI
  - Place figures as their own bullet point, e.g. "- Figure 1: Circuit schematic of experiment"
  - Repeat until each idea is in the right place (to ~90% surety)
    - This will likely require several passes through the outline
  - Continue adding to the scratchpad while doing the writing: the point is to capture all the details that spring to mind in one place (you don't need to use all of them, just don't want to miss any)
  - If collaborating: this step is the most crucial for getting everyone to agree on the logical flow of the paper
  - Example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SVXOa2Tx7_3D5qbV1GMHinb16MC-tZsNUzOw43C9G7c/edit

### Step 3: Flesh out the outline: Convert each bullet point into a complete thought
  - Revise each bullet point into complete sentences (~1-3 sentences)
  - Only work on fleshing out the outline, do **not** do any calculation/analysis
    - Write "fixme" where needed e.g. "Our transistor will require [fixme 100W? calculate power] of power when implemented."
  - Avoid writing grammar/transitions between separate points, you may be reordering the points as you flesh things out
  - Goal: Each bullet point is well-written enough to be pasted into the paper without modification and have a quasi-readable paper
  - Example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVV6VOanVaIH8BwYBuEermebI2L-4HI0Ljhx3w3bbak/edit

4.  Write the first draft
    - At this stage you should really only be adding things like transitions between sentences and tidying up the language; the paper should be mostly written already (just in bullet-point form)
    - Finished example: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0157645

 

# Other notes:

- Once you're at step 4, before you sit down to write each time, review one previously-written paragraph very thoroughly for clarity/flow. Mark "REVIEWME" on next paragraph for next time.
- Try not to switch processes: e.g. when outlining, donâ€™t switch to drawing figures/doing calculations
- Once draft completely written, compile list of fixmes and start cranking through them one by one
