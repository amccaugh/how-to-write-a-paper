# Initial setup

- Make new plaintext file / Google Doc
  - Write in plain text to avoid wasting time formatting, fighting LaTeX, etc.
- Label 3 sections: "Scratchpad", "Figures", and "Outline"
  - "Scratchpad" is where you will put ideas that don't have a home in the outline yet
  - "Figures" will hold any ideas for figures/graphics you have
  - "Outline" is where you will develop your basic outline
 
# Steps 

*The goal is to work on one single step for at least 20 mins at a time, repeatedly until the step is completed.  Resist the urge to skip ahead*

### Step 0: Generate topics that may be relevant to the paper
  - Write down each topic as its own line under "Scratchpad". Each topic should only be a few words
  - Any ideas for figures should go in "Figures"
  - Potential areas to think about when coming up with ideas:  Motivation, Previous work/background, Theory, Results, Experimental setup, Conclusion, Equipment, Fabrication, Parameters, Modeling, Simulation, Caveats
  - Write down any ideas/topics relevant to the paper, even if only somewhat related -- not all ideas from the scratchpad will end up in the outline, but the point is to make sure you don't forget/miss any ideas later on

### Step 1: Group topics into rough sections
  - Look over your scratchpad ideas and try to come up with rough groupings for the topics
    - e.g. motivation, background, theory, experiment 1, experiment 2, analysis, future work
  - Cut the topics out of the "Scratchpad" section and paste them into your rough groupings
  - Continue organizing until most topics from your scratchpad have an (approximate) home
  - Place figures as their own bullet point, e.g. "- Figure: Circuit schematic of experiment"
  - If you think of new topics, add them to the scratchpad

### Step 2: Create the logical flow
*Note: Include your collaborators on this step. It is the most crucial for getting everyone to agree on the logical flow of the paper*
  - In each section, try to sort the topics into a rough logical order
  - Expand each topic into very simple bullet points
    - Use very short sentences & do not use correct grammar!
  - Repeat this step until each idea is in the right place (to ~90% surety), will require several passes through the outline
  - Continue adding to the scratchpad while doing the writing
  - Example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SVXOa2Tx7_3D5qbV1GMHinb16MC-tZsNUzOw43C9G7c/edit
- #### Why?
    - Short sentences are easier to quickly parse--and rearrange--than long ones
    - Any effort you put into writing well-structured/good-sounding sentences will work against you, as it will be harder to read and you may grow attached to the wording which will cause you trouble when fleshing out the outline.
    - Most of these points will likely be rewritten/reformatted as your outline evolves, so you don't want to waste effort writing sentences with good grammar
    - The point of the scratchpad is to capture any miscellaneous detail/idea that might spring to mind while you're creating the logical flow of the outline.  By adding these thoughts directly to the scratchpad, you both (1) capture them and (2) avoid diverting your attention away from the task of creating logical flow.
    - Example:
      - silicon good for making transistors
      - transistors used for digital computation
      - digital computation important to AI
      - silicon necessary for AI

### Step 3: Convert each bullet point into a complete thought
  - Rewrite each logical bullet point into complete sentences (~1-3 sentences)
  - Only focus on writing out full sentences, do **not** do any calculation/reading/figure-making
    - Write "fixme" where needed e.g. "Our transistor will require (fixme 100W? calculate power) of power when implemented."
  - Avoid writing grammar/transitions between separate points, you may be reordering the points as you flesh things out
  - Goal: Each bullet point is well-written enough to be pasted into the paper without modification and have a quasi-readable paper
  - Example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVV6VOanVaIH8BwYBuEermebI2L-4HI0Ljhx3w3bbak/edit
- #### Why?
    - The point of this step is to convert your shorthand statements to full, grammatically-correct sentences as painlessly as possible.
    - What is tempting is to interrupt the (hard) process of writing English in order to do (easier/more fun) analysis, making figures, background reading, etc.
    - Avoid this temptation! You will be surprised at how quickly you can bring the paper to near-complete form if you only focus on converting your logical arguments to grammatically-correct English

### Step 4: Convert the outline to the first draft
  - Go through all your "fixme" comments and address them
  - At this stage you should really only be adding things like transitions between sentences and tidying up the language; the paper should be mostly written already (just in bullet-point form)
    - Finished example: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0157645

 

# Other notes:

- Once you're at step 4, before you sit down to write each time, review one previously-written paragraph very thoroughly for clarity/flow. Mark "REVIEWME" on next paragraph for next time.
- Try not to switch processes: e.g. when outlining, donâ€™t switch to drawing figures/doing calculations
- Once draft completely written, compile list of fixmes and start cranking through them one by one
